linux
=====

Common linux scripts I have used that I would like to keep in case I change distros.

Use: Unless otherwise specified all scripts are accessable by placing them in /usr/bin. If there are any permission errors use chmod +x to make scripts executable. 

I will attempt to keep the directory structure of scripts the same as they exist in the system so that you should only have to merge to get the scripts functionality. 


Scripts added

1. wgetdir - Simple wget script for grabbing the files from a directory without the excessive folder data (usage: getdir 'link') Downloads to current directory as individual files so be careful where you are!
